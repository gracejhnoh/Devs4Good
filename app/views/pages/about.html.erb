  <div class='mission-expand'>
    There is no doubt that the tech industry has had a huge impact on society - not only here in Seattle, but throughout the world. Our mission is to provide a platform through which web developers can volunteer their time, experience, and skills, so that they can give back to their communities. This is a place for all non-profit organizations to come forward with their project ideas, so that we, as members of the tech industry, can help make those dreams and visions a reality. <br />
